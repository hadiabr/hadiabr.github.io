<h2>INTO:</h2><br>
<p>
Nelson Mandela, the South African activist and former president,  helped bring an end to apartheid and has been a global reformer for human rights. He led the emancipation of South Africa from white minority rule and served as his country's first black president, becoming an international emblem of dignity and forbearance, died Thursday night. He was 95.<br></p>
   <p>
 His actions landed him in prison for nearly three decades and made him the face of the antiapartheid movement both within his country and internationally.  He was later released in 1990.  He ran for president of South Africa and won the spot in 1994, becoming the nation's first black president. After retiring from politics in 1999, he remained a committed champion for peace and social justice around the world until his death at the age of 95 in 2013.<br><br>
</p>




   <h2>Early days :</h2><br>
<p>
Nelson Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, into a royal family of the Thembu tribe in the village of Mvezo, where his father,  Henry, was the chief. In  1927, the 9-year-old Mandela lost his father. Hence, he was adopted by  Jongintaba Dalindyebo.<br><br>
</p>


   <h2>Education:</h2><br>
<p>
The first in his family to receive a formal education, Mandela completed his primary studies at a local missionary school. There, a teacher dubbed him Nelson as part of a common practice of giving African students English names. He went on to attend the Clarkebury Boarding Institute and Healdtown, a Methodist secondary school, where he excelled in boxing and track as well as academics. In 1939 Mandela entered the elite University of Fort Hare, the only Western-style higher learning institute for South African blacks at the time. The following year, he and several other students, including his friend and future business partner Oliver Tambo (1917-1993), were sent home for participating in a boycott against university policies.<br><br>
</p>


   <h2>The African National Congress (ANC):</h2><br>
<p>
Nelson Mandela's commitment to politics and the ANC grew stronger after the 1948 election victory of the Afrikaner-dominated National Party, which introduced a formal system of racial classification and segregational apartheid that restricted nonwhites basic rights and barred them from the government while maintaining white minority rule. The following year, the ANC adopted the ANCYLs plan to achieve full citizenship for all South Africans through boycotts, strikes, civil disobedience and other nonviolent methods. Mandela helped lead the ANCs 1952 Campaign for the Defiance of Unjust Laws, travelling across the country to organize protests against discriminatory policies, and promoted the manifesto known as the Freedom Charter, ratified by the Congress of the People in 1955. Also in 1952, Mandela and Tambo opened South Africas first black law firm, which offered free or low-cost legal counsel to those affected by apartheid legislation.<br></p>
<p>
On December 5, 1956, Mandela and 155 other activists were arrested and went on trial for treason. All of the defendants were acquitted in 1961, but in the meantime tensions within the ANC escalated, with a militant faction splitting off in 1959 to form the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). The next year, police opened fire on peaceful black protesters in the township of Sharpeville, killing 69 people; as panic, anger and riots swept the country in the massacre's aftermath, the apartheid government banned both the ANC and the PAC. Forced to go underground and wear disguises to evade detection, Mandela decided that the time had come for a more radical approach than passive resistance.<br><br>

</p>

   <h2>Years Behind The Bars:</h2><br>
<p>
Nelson Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail at the brutal Robben Island Prison, a former leper colony off the coast of Cape Town, where he was confined to a small cell without a bed or plumbing and compelled to do hard labour in a lime quarry. As a black political prisoner, he received scantier rations and fewer privileges than other inmates. <br></p>
<p>
These restrictions and conditions notwithstanding, while in confinement Mandela earned a bachelor of law degree from the University of London and served as a mentor to his fellow prisoners, encouraging them to seek better treatment through nonviolent resistance. He also smuggled out political statements and a draft of his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, published five years after his release.<br>
</p>
   <p>
The newly elected president F. W. de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and called for a nonracist South Africa, breaking with the conservatives in his party. On February 11, 1990, he ordered Mandela's release.<br><br>
</p>
   <h2>Nelson For President:</h2><br>
   <p>
After attaining his freedom, Nelson Mandela led the ANC in its negotiations with the governing National Party and various other South African political organizations for an end to apartheid and the establishment of a multiracial government. Though fraught with tension and conducted against a backdrop of political instability, the talks earned Mandela and de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize in December 1993. On April 26, 1994, more than 22 million South Africans turned out to cast ballots in the country's first multiracial parliamentary elections in history. An overwhelming majority chose the ANC to lead the country, and on May 10 Mandela was sworn in as the first black president of South Africa, with de Klerk serving as his first deputy.<br><br></p>



   <h2>Mandela's Later Years and Legacy:</h2><br>
<p>
After leaving office, Nelson Mandela remained a devoted champion for peace and social justice in his own country and around the world. He established several organizations, including the influential Nelson Mandela Foundation and The Elders, an independent group of public figures committed to addressing global problems and easing human suffering. In 2002, Mandela became a vocal advocate of AIDS awareness and treatment programs in a culture where the epidemic had been cloaked in stigma and ignorance. The disease later claimed the life of his son Makgatho (1950-2005) and is believed to affect more people in South Africa than in any other country. And at the age of 95 in 2013, he breathes his final breath.<br><br></p>
